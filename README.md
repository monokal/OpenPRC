# OpenPRC

## Programmable Recrystallization Chamber

The OpenPRC project aims to produce an inexpensive and Open Source device for growing crystals from saturated solutions.

The hardware is primarily Arduino based which is inexpensive, readily available and easily expandable.

The software is C/C++ based and makes use of various OpenPRC maintained and public Arduino libraries.

Contributions, whether in the form of code, hardware design, documentation or suggestions are all greatly encouraged and appreciated.
